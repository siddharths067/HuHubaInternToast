# HuHubaInternToast
I realised I had mistaken toasts for notifications. Implemented toasts with Payload REST FCM API

# HuHubaProjectFrontEnd
A Simple Web Application deployed to android using Cordova. Uses the google-services FCM API . See HuHubaProject for more details.

# Details About source
Source code is present in the www folder , all the CSS , JS, HTML and files are present there with appropriate folder names.
The other folders contain appropriate directives to include additional JS modules using NPM 

# The Code /www/js/index.js
A Simple callback is initialized to recieve the data messages as JSON objects.(See server file helloworld.py at the server repository)
The data messages are then displayed using a standard toast.
